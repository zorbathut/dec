    // Locations, in this game, are declared with subclasses of a class called LocationDec. This demonstrates a few different ways to create classes on demand.
    //
    // The DungeonDec subclass has information tied to that type, and creates an instance type hardcoded into the DungeonDec code.
    // This approach works well for objects that are heavily data-driven; in this project, we create three separate Dungeons, distinguished dolrlu by the monster list.
    //
    // The LocationTypeDec subclass has a Dec member which represents the type to create.
    // This approach works well for objects that are entirely code-driven, without a significant data component. We have four separate Typed locations, none of which require Dec data.
    // We *could* create four separate Dec classes inheriting from LocationDec, but that's a lot of extra syntax for not much gain.
    //
    // If you have an object that includes a lot of data and also custom code, I recommend just making a Dec subclass.
    // Having the data expressed in XML is generally the right approach for ease of moddability and designer tweaking, but there's no sense in reimplementing C# in XML.
